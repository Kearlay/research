## (2) EEG Classification for Motor Imagery Tasks using CNN and LSTM
Overview
--------

TensorFlow and Keras implementation of Zhang et al(2018), "EEG-based Intention Recognition from Spatio-Temporal Representations via Cascade and Parallel Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks" for EEG motar imagery classification on PhysioNet data (https://archive.physionet.org/pn4/eegmmidb/). Stacked CNN and RNN were applied on time-distributed sliding windows of raw EEG data.
